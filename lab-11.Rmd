# Part 1: Simple linear regression

## Exercise 1

> Fit a linear model (one you have fit before): m_bty, predicting average professor evaluation score based on average beauty rating (bty_avg) only. Write the linear model, and note the R-squared and the adjusted R-squared.

```{r m_bty}
m_bty <- summary(lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals))
m_bty
```

score = 3.89 + .07 x bty_avg + error

R-squared = .04

adjusted R-squared = .03

# Part 2: Multiple linear regression
